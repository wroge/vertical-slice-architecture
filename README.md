# Vertical Slice Architecture

This repository showcases how to build a Vertical Slice API that supports multiple SQL dialects using [huma](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/huma) and [sqlt](https://github.com/wroge/sqlt).

```go
// Run as local In-memory sqlite app
go run ./cmd/sqlite/main.go
// open: http://localhost:8080/docs


// Or run as postgres app with docker
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=db -p 5432:5432 postgres:16
go run ./cmd/postgres/main.go
// open: http://localhost:8080/docs

// stop and remove container:
docker stop postgres && docker rm postgres
```

## Highlights

- Huma is a great framework for OpenAPI generation and validation that works with any web framework.
- Without a repository layer, each query is designed perfectly for its specific use case, avoiding poor reuse.
- The SQL templates are a flexible and powerful tool that let you focus on business logic.

## Feedback

Take a look at the code and give me feedback. Thanks :)
